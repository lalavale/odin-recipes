    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups day old cook white rice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 lightly beaten eggs</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, green peas)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 stalks of green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Break up any clumps of the day-old rice and set aside.
            Chop and prepare all vegetables and protein. Beat the eggs
            in a small bowl. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat 1 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over 
            medium-high heat. Add beaten eggs and scramble until fully cooked. 
            Remove the eggs from the pan and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the same pan.
Add minced garlic (and ginger, if using) and saut√© for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Add the chopped onion to the pan and cook until it becomes translucent.
            Add mixed vegetables and stir-fry until they are tender but still crisp.
            If using raw protein, cook it now until fully done. If using pre-cooked protein, just stir it in to heat through.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the cooked rice to the pan. Stir well to combine with the vegetables and protein.
            Cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently, to ensure the rice is heated through and starting to get a bit crispy.
        </li>

        <li>
            Pour the soy sauce and sesame oil over the rice mixture.
            Stir well to evenly coat the rice with the sauce.
            Add salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>

        <li>
            Return the scrambled eggs to the pan, breaking them up into small pieces.
            Add the sliced green onions and mix everything thoroughly.
        </li>

        <li>
            Continue to stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes, ensuring all ingredients are well combined and heated through.
        </li>

        <li>
            Remove from heat and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade fried rice!
