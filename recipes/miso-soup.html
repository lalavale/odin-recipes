    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup known for its comforting, umami-rich flavor. The base of the soup is dashi, a stock typically made
        from kombu (dried kelp) and bonito flakes (dried fish). Miso paste, made from fermented soybeans, is then dissolved into the dashi, giving the
        soup its distinctive savory taste.

        Common additions to miso soup include tofu cubes, seaweed, and thinly sliced green onions. Some variations might also include ingredients like 
        mushrooms, daikon radish, or carrots. The soup is usually served hot and often accompanies meals in Japanese cuisine.
