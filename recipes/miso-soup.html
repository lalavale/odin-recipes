    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup known for its comforting, umami-rich flavor. The base of the soup is dashi, a stock typically made
        from kombu (dried kelp) and bonito flakes (dried fish). Miso paste, made from fermented soybeans, is then dissolved into the dashi, giving the
        soup its distinctive savory taste.
    </p>

    <p>
        Common additions to miso soup include tofu cubes, seaweed, and thinly sliced green onions. Some variations might also include ingredients like 
        mushrooms, daikon radish, or carrots. The soup is usually served hot and often accompanies meals in Japanese cuisine.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dashi stock: 4 cups water, 1 piece kombu, 1/2 cup bonito flakes</li>
        <li>3-4 tbsp miso paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tofu, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup wakame, soaked in water until rehydrated and drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>
            In a pot, combine 4 cups of water and the piece of kombu. Heat until just before boiling, then remove the kombu. Add the bonito flakes and let 
            them steep for about 5 minutes. Strain the stock and return it to the pot.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bring the dashi stock to a simmer. Add the cubed tofu and rehydrated wakame seaweed to the pot, allowing them to heat through for a few minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            In a small bowl, mix 3-4 tablespoons of miso paste with a bit of the hot dashi to dissolve it, then add this mixture back into the pot. Stir gently
             to combine. Finally, add the sliced green onions and serve the soup hot.
